Fast Universal Google Analytics setup for Rails. This gem is mostly intended for small to medium websites with a simple analytics strategy.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bgarret/google-analytics-rails.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bgarret/google-analytics-rails)

_if you require older analytics, use `0.0.6`_

Installation
============

Add the following to your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'google-analytics-rails', '1.0.0'

Then run:

    bundle install

Upgrade Notes
============

__Upgrading this gem from 0.0.6?__

Use `analytics_init` to send submissions to Analytics if you are using multiple trackers. You can supply a name to tracker by passing `:name` option.

**GoogleAnalytics::Events::SetAllowLinker** is no longer supported as an external variable being set. You can submit as normal in the `:add_events` array, but using the new `:setup` config is preferable so no extra array searching has to happen.

**GoogleAnalytics::Events::SetCustomVar** is no longer supported by Universal Analytics. These have been changed to SetCustomDimension & SetCustomMetric. By default if you use SetCustomVar, it applies as a Dimension

**GoogleAnalytics::Events::DeleteCustomVar** has been removed

**Added Event Helpers**

  - GoogleAnalytics::Events::ExperimentId
  - GoogleAnalytics::Events::ExperimentVariation

**TODO:** Add Double Click Snippet Support
While the code is there, and it looks like it is simply changing the end path to the JS, this feature has not been tested.
